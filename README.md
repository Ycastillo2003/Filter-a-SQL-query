# SQL: Filtering an SQL query
In this project, SQL was used to retrieve specific subsets of data from a database by applying filtering conditions with the WHERE clause. The goal was to extract meaningful information by narrowing down results based on defined criteria such as dates, user roles, activity status, or device types.

# Environments and Technologies Used.
- Google Cloud Virtual Machines.
- SQL (Structured Query Language).

# Actions and observations.

 In this scenario, we need to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments theyâ€™re in. Our team needs this data to perform various tasks, such as running updates, posting a privacy notice in certain departments, and sending an alert to an employee with an issue on a machine.

- using SELECT device_id, operating_system FROM machines;.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34f6ca3d-8c79-4bb5-aee6-dd0dce74d9bd)

- Receiving over 200 rows of data.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/582e24ad-5ef7-4de0-adc3-40262e3255a8)

- Using the WHERE clause and making  operating_system = OS 2 to further narrow our search.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d30286b5-b449-4fe5-9ed1-bdbf99200183)

- Now our search has been reduced from 200 rows to 80, and we have filtered for OS 2 using the WHERE clause.

 In this task, we need to retrieve a list of all the employees in the Finance and Sales departments to obtain their office numbers. A notice about handling confidential financial information will be posted to these offices.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e9b6dba-4864-4fa1-96e7-dac8e59c40ae)

- We will start with the finance department, as you can see in the picture above, with the SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance'; command to only get finance department data from the employees tables.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/178588d4-1f91-4153-b970-9f27a3a8bd7d)

- Now we can see all the info pertaining to the employees in the finance department.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e61c067-7fd3-468e-b7ad-663cf4083e45)

- Now we are going to do the same thing, but for the sales department.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5721bc4b-a9fb-4a8f-bbab-a84fc4217172)

- Now we have the info for employees for the sales department.

Our team recently discovered that there are issues with machines in the South building. In this task, we need to obtain certain employee and computer information.

A machine in 'South-109' has an issue. WE need to determine which employee uses that computer so you can send them an alert.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4290e83a-4d8b-4deb-a803-af4558873a02)

- After using the WHERE clause to filter the Office Column of the employees table, we see that Jlasnky in the finance department, employee_id 1010, is who we have to notify.


Next, our team has determined that there is an issue with all the machines in the South building. Offices in the organization are named with the building name, a hyphen, and the office number in that building (for example, 'South-109').

WE Modify the query we used in the previous step so that it returns information on all the employees in the 'South' building.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c1650fd-6ac4-4c33-aee9-27cd46e79d6c)

- Using comparison operator LIKE 'south%' to filter for entries that have zero or more characters after south

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7d1e65b-e840-4743-8193-24e51abf2920)

- Now we have an entire overview of the south building.

In this next task, we need to investigate a recent security incident. To do this, you need to gather information about login attempts made after a certain date.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c2a9719-b09d-4cba-a32c-404f6bba75df)

- The operator > lets us filter for dates greater than. In this example, we need dates greater than 22-05-09.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93953087-7aea-4cf7-82a2-c0efd4f528d0)

- Now the data we get back from the log_in_attempts TABLE are all after the 22-05-09 date since we used the operator >.

- Now to have more context investigating this security incident so using >= we make it so the data we get back from the query  are the events that happened on 22-05-09 and after. 

     We figured out that the accident happened before 22-05-11 so to get results that happened between 22-05-09 and 22-05-11.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b30c6b85-28bf-4893-b2fa-4b673283229f)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62235f0a-03ef-4faa-acf2-ccc9bb339b8f)

- Using THE operators BETWEEN & AND, we filtered our query search to show events happening between 2 certain dates. Now we also know the incident happened after work hours, so we can filter the time to only show data from after work hours.
