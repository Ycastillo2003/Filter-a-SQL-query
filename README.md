# SQL: Filtering a SQL query
In this project, SQL was used to retrieve specific subsets of data from a database by applying filtering conditions with the WHERE clause. The goal was to extract meaningful information by narrowing down results based on defined criteria such as dates, user roles, activity status, or device types.

# Environments and Technologies Used.
- Google Cloud Virtual Machines.
- SQL (Structured Query Language).

# Actions and observations.

 In this scenario, we need to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments theyâ€™re in. Our team needs this data to perform various tasks, such as running updates, posting a privacy notice in certain departments, and sending an alert to an employee with an issue on a machine.
